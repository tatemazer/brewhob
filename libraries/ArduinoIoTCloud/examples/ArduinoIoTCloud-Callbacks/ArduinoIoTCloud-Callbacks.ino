/*
  This sketch demonstrates how to subscribe to IoT Cloud events and perform actions
  The available events are

  CONNECT     : Board successfully connects to IoT Cloud
  SYNC        : Data is successfully synced between Board and IoT Cloud
  DISCONNECT  : Board has lost connection to IoT Cloud

  You don't need any specific Properties to be created in order to demonstrate these functionalities.
  Simply create a new Thing and give it 1 arbitrary Property.
  Remember that the Thing ID needs to be configured in thingProperties.h 
  These events can be very useful in particular cases, for instance to disable a peripheral
  or a connected sensor/actuator when no data connection is available, as well as to perform
  specific operations on connection or right after properties values are synchronised.

  To subscribe to an event you can use the `addCallback` method and specify
  which event will trigger which custom function.
  One function per event can be assigned.

  IMPORTANT:
  This sketch works with WiFi, GSM, NB and Lora enabled boards supported by Arduino IoT Cloud.
  On a LoRa board, if it is configuered as a class A device (default and preferred option), values from Cloud dashboard are received
  only after a value is sent to Cloud.

  This sketch is compatible with:
   - MKR 1000
   - MKR WIFI 1010
   - MKR GSM 1400
   - MKR NB 1500
   - MKR WAN 1300/1310
   - Nano 33 IoT
   - ESP 8266

      Invoking `addCallback` on the ArduinoCloud object allows you to subscribe
      to any of the available events and decide which functions to call when they are fired.

      The functions `doThisOnConnect`, `doThisOnSync`, `doThisOnDisconnect`
      are custom functions and can be named to your likings and for this example
      they are defined/implemented at the bottom of the Sketch
